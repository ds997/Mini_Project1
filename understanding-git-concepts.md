# Understanding Forking vs Clonning## ForkA fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.![Images](resources/github-fork.png)## CloneThe clone command downloads an existing Git repository to your local computer.You will then have a full-blown, local version of that Git repo and can start working on the project.![Images](resources/https-url-clone.png)## Difference Cloning downloads a copy of the repository to your local machine while forking copies the repository to your github account (still hosted on github), making it appear under the list of your repositories.# Pull RequestWhen you file a pull request, all you’re doing is requesting that another developer (e.g., the project maintainer) pulls a branch from your repository into their repository. This means that you need to provide 4 pieces of information to file a pull request: the source repository, the source branch, the destination repository, and the destination branch.* A developer creates the feature in a dedicated branch in their local repo.* The developer pushes the branch to a public GitHub repository.* The developer files a pull request via GitHub.* The rest of the team reviews the code, discusses it, and alters it.* The project maintainer merges the feature into the official repository and closes the pull request.![Images](resources/pullrequest.png)![Images](resources/pullrequest1.png)* In their simplest form, pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. * Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their GitHub account. * This lets everybody involved know that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.* But, the pull request is more than just a notification—it’s a dedicated forum for discussing the proposed feature. * If there are any problems with the changes, teammates can post feedback in the pull request and even tweak the feature by pushing follow-up commits. * All of this activity is tracked directly inside of the pull request.
