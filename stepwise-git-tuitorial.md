# A step by step guide to Git# Step 1: Create a GitHub account![Image](resources/git_guide1.png)![Image](resources/git_guide2.png)# Step 2: Create a new repositoryA repository is like a place or a container where something is stored; in this case we're creating a Git repository to store code. To create a new repository, select New Repository from the + sign dropdown menu (you can see I've selected it in the upper-right corner in the image above).![Image](resources/git_guide3.png)Enter a name for your repository (e.g, "Demo") and click Create Repository.# Step 3: Create a file![Image](resources/git_guide4.png) Look at the section that starts "...or create a new repository on the command line," and ignore the rest for now.Open the Terminal program on your computer.![Image](resources/git_guide5.png)Type git and hit Enter. If it says command bash: git: command not found, then install Git with the command for your Linux operating system or distribution. Check the installation by typing git and hitting Enter; if it's installed, you should see a bunch of information about how you can use the command.In the terminal, type:mkdir DemoThis command will create a directory (or folder) named Demo.Change your terminal to the Demo directory with the command:cd DemoThen enter:echo "#Demo" >> README.mdThis creates a file named README.md and writes cat README.mdThis will show you what is inside the README.md file, if the file was created correctly. To tell your computer that Demo is a directory managed by the Git program, enter:git initThen, to tell the Git program you care about this file and want to track any changes from this point forward, enter:git add README.md# Step 4: Make a commitSo far you've created a file and told Git about it, and now it's time to create a commit. Commit can be thought of as a milestone. Every time you accomplish some work, you can write a Git commit to store that version of your file, so you can go back later and see what it looked like at that point in time. Whenever you make a change to your file, you create a new version of that file, different from the previous one.
