# A step by step guide to Git# Step 1: Create a GitHub account![Image](resources/git_guide1.png)![Image](resources/git_guide2.png)# Step 2: Create a new repositoryA repository is like a place or a container where something is stored; in this case we're creating a Git repository to store code. To create a new repository, select New Repository from the + sign dropdown menu (you can see I've selected it in the upper-right corner in the image above).![Image](resources/git_guide3.png)Enter a name for your repository (e.g, "Demo") and click Create Repository.# Step 3: Create a file![Image](resources/git_guide4.png) Look at the section that starts "...or create a new repository on the command line," and ignore the rest for now.Open the Terminal program on your computer.![Image](resources/git_guide5.png)Type git and hit Enter. If it says command bash: git: command not found, then install Git with the command for your Linux operating system or distribution. Check the installation by typing git and hitting Enter; if it's installed, you should see a bunch of information about how you can use the command.In the terminal, type:mkdir DemoThis command will create a directory (or folder) named Demo.Change your terminal to the Demo directory with the command:cd DemoThen enter:echo "#Demo" >> README.mdThis creates a file named README.md and writes cat README.mdThis will show you what is inside the README.md file, if the file was created correctly. To tell your computer that Demo is a directory managed by the Git program, enter:git initThen, to tell the Git program you care about this file and want to track any changes from this point forward, enter:git add README.md# Step 4: Make a commitSo far you've created a file and told Git about it, and now it's time to create a commit. Commit can be thought of as a milestone. Every time you accomplish some work, you can write a Git commit to store that version of your file, so you can go back later and see what it looked like at that point in time. Whenever you make a change to your file, you create a new version of that file, different from the previous one.# Step 5: Connect your GitHub repo with your computerNow, it's time to connect your computer to GitHub with the command:git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_username>/Demo.gitLet's look at this command step by step. We are telling Git to add a remote called origin with the address https://github.com/<your_username>/Demo.git (i.e., the URL of your Git repo on GitHub.com). This allows you to interact with your Git repository on GitHub.com by typing origin instead of the full URL and Git will know where to send your code. Why origin? Well, you can name it anything else if you'd like.Now we have connected our local copy of the Demo repository to its remote counterpart on GitHub.com. Your terminal looks like this:![Image](resources/git_guide7.png)And if you go to https://github.com/<your_username>/Demo you will see something like this:![Images](resources/git_guide10.png)# Working collaboratively with more than Two person in Simple Steps:﻿﻿## On Github we have a master branch and a dev branch* The master branch is the same as production or contains deployment ready code* The dev branch is ahead of master and contains all new code currently being worked on* Locally we three work on the dev branch and push to github when something is ready* The other dev fetches any new changes from the dev branch before pushing his new code* When dev branch is good,we merge with the master branch* Locally we have several feature branches issue branches etc.Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file,
