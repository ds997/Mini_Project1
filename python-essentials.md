##Python Essential Terminologies
**1. How Python uses Indentation to control Flow:-**
Control flow in your code is to affect the order in which the code in your program is executed. Up until this point in the course, you have seen (and hopefully written) code that executes linearly.


simple code without any "control flow"
i.e. no branches in logic, loops, or # code encapsulation
```
x = 6 
y = 23
print("x + y = ", x + y)
print("x - y = ", x - y)
```

**2. Don’t repeat yourself:-**
The Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle states that duplication in logic should be eliminated via abstraction; duplication in process should be eliminated via automation.
Duplication is Waste
Adding additional, unnecessary code to a codebase increases the amount of work required to extend and maintain the software in the future.  Duplicate code adds to technical debt.
